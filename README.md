# Teach Yourself CS

This is my attempt at completing the Computer Science curriculum laid out by Oz Nova and Myles Byrne at [teachyourselfcs.com](https://www.teachyourselfcs.com). Beneath you can see my take on why I chose the courses I did for each subject, things that helped accelerate my learning journey, the mistakes I made so you won't, supplementary materials, and my solutions to the different homework problems, labs, and projects.

But this repo has more to it than the curriculum. I'm also documenting my journey here and listing all the things I did that are relevant to the CS field and my goals of becoming a programmer at one of the best tech companies. I also want to get into quant because of how much companies in that industry pay, but we'll see how it goes.
